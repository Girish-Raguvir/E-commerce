-coupon code input during payment-Coupon applied message(make appropriate changes)-and wrong code-No such coupon exists error.

-Captcha check

-Cart Modal in Items.html doesnot reflect changes unless page is refreshed.

-Somehow not able to dynamically update the content of the modal.It's kind of a big problem for the cart modal.We have to update it simultaneously.Currently,refreshing the page only updates it.That should not be the case.
