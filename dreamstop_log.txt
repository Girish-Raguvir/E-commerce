-Cart Modal in Items.html doesnot reflect changes unless page is refreshed.



TO ANIRUDH

In all other pages except index.html,the text of the popover has it's font-weight changing depending on hover.Only the <a> tag location must have it and not the popover content as well.

Put in checks on the details entered during delivery details modal as well.

I am somehow not able to dynamically update the content of the modal.It's kind of a big problem for the cart modal.We have to update it simultaneously.Currently,refreshing the page only updates it.That should not be the case.

Put in a bigger image of yours. 200px X 200px is best.
